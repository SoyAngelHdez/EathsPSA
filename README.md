# Eath's PSA
Little practice using pandas to get a secret message

This practice is directed for the pandas library
>Here's is the message from Earth: 'I remember that if you sort the countries (or dependencies) [Guinea, Iran, Trinidad And Tobago, Honduras, Lebanon, Ethiopia, Niger, Afghanistan, India, American Samoa, Cuba, Gabon, Nicaragua, Channel Islands, Martinique] by density of population (DESCENDING) and then only look at the first letter of each country, you'll get my message back!! Can you help me please?'
>
>To help our planet, we preloaded world population and geographical data from the website Worldometer (https://worldometers.info/). Use it to do what the earth says and decode the message!

So I merged the two dataframes I was given, cleaned the countries I did not need, calculated the population density and sorted the countries to get the message.
